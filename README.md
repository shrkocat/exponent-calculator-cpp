# Exponent Calculator
This is a program coded in ***C++*** that prompts the user to choose between choices *y* meaning *yes*, and *n* meaning *no*. If user chooses *y*, the whole program executes and asks the user to input a base number and an exponent number. If the input is valid then it would calculate in loops until it achieves the desired number of iterations and displays the result.

# C++
This program uses ***do-while*** looping statements and iterations from a counter variable (***int count***) that should equal to the value of the inputted exponent by adding 1 to itself each execution and repeats the process of multiplication of the base number. Having ***do-while loops*** for input processes, means that the statements inside the loop body will be executed at least once even if the condition is never true. The do while loop is an exit controlled loop, where even if the test condition is false, the loop body will be executed at least once. After the program calculates and displays the final output value, then the program will promt the user again with ***y*** or ***n*** whether to start over again or exit.
